	<h2>Let's get started....</h2> 
	<br>
	<h3>Simply enter your topic into the search bar - and it will return Youtube videos on that subject.</h3>
	<br>
	<p> Selecting a thumbnail allows you to watch that specific video. When you find a video you want to take notes on, click the 'Take Notes' link below the viewer, and you'll open a new note. You can choose to download a PDF of your note when you're done, or wait until later -- your notes will all be saved.</p> 
	<br>
	<p>To view previously taken notes, click on the 'Saved Notes' link in the navigation. There you can view, make changes to, or download archived notes. Or, if you're done, you can delete them.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Now try it for yourself -- enter your first search words into the search bar above and see what happens.</h2>
