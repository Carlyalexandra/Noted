	<h1>Welcome to Noted!</h1>

	<p>If you want to take notes on videos as they play without hassle of going back and forth between windows you've come to the right place.</p><br> 
	
	<h2>We offer side by side note taking.</h2> <br>	

	<p>And when you're done, you'll have a downloadable PDF for your files that includes the link to your video.</p> 
	<br>
	<h3>Let's get started....</h3> 
	<br>
	<p>Simply enter your topic into the search bar - and it will return Youtube videos on that subject.</p>
	<br>
	<p> Selecting a thumbnail will allow you to watch that video. When you find a video you want to take notes on, click the 'Take Notes' link below the viewer, and you'll open a new note. You can choose to download your PDF when you are done, or wait until later -- your notes will all be saved. </p> 
	<br>
	<p>To view previous taken notes, click on the 'Saved Notes' link in the navigation. There you can view, make changes to, or download archived notes. Or delete them.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Now try it for yourself by enter your first search into the search bar above and see what happens.</h4>
